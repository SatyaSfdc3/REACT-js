React

Libraries to import
	React - React.createElement
	ReactDom - ReactDom.render(what to render, where to render);
	
React.createElement(type, attributes, innerHTML);

Old Version
var element = React.createElement('div', { id: 'div1'}, 'Welcome to Demo');

New Version 
var element = <div> Welcome to Demo 2</div>;

In New Version, we write JSX.

HTML vs JSX
	JSX tags should close. 
	
HTML
	Not Compiled.
	UI Elements are added to screen directly.
JSX
	Compiled
	It will be converted into old standard(React.CreateElement) and then elements are created dynamically.
	
function TestComponent(props) {

}

in Old syntax
TestComponent({ name: ''});

in JSX
<TestComponent name='' />
